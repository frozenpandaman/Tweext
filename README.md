# Tweext

A small utility for converting plain text files (short stories, books in the public domain, etc.) into Twee files, for use with [Twine](http://twinery.org/).

The basic Twee format can be seen [here](http://twinery.org/wiki/writing_source_code_files).

I'll probably rename this project at some point (or at the very least, remove this line regarding the potential renaming.)
